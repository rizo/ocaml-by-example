# OCaml by example

Code examples for OCaml.

The examples assume that you have a working [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) environment. Examples use the [dune](https://dune.build) build system and [odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc) for documentation generation.

```
# Install the required tools
$ opam install dune odoc
```

## Examples

- [hello-world](https://github.com/rizo/ocaml-by-example/tree/main/hello-world) - a small executable that prints a "hello world" message.
- [basic-lib-doc](https://github.com/rizo/ocaml-by-example/tree/main/basic-lib-doc) - a small executable and a library with documentation.
